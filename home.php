                            <p>The paint we use is purchased from <b>Haley Paint</b>. It is a Latex paint that has a
                                semi-gloss finish and is 100% acrylic which means you can count on outstanding
                                flexibility and durability. Not only is our paint of great quality, it is also of
                                great value. Never the less we have included it with the price of our sheds. We have
                                a wide variety of colors available, and additional colors are also available.</p>

                            <p><b>LP Smart Siding Trim</b> is the trim of champions. Why, you ask? LP Smart Trim
                                will not delaminate as it is not hardboard, and is moisture, rot and termite
                                resistant, because it is treated with zinc borate. LP Smart Trim excels in all four
                                seasons. Because it is specially treated, it’s more cost-effective over time than
                                other types of trim with laminant or a wood base. Our trim lasts longer and holds
                                paint better. Thanks to LP's patented Smart Guard manufacturing process, Smart Trim
                                is uniformly thick and dense, with no voids or knots. It is, simply put, the best.
